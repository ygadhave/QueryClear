- Problem Statment:
 
  - Students lack accessible and convenient ways to connect with experienced seniors and alumni from their own college, hindering their ability to get academic help, career guidance, and mentorship.

  - We need a platform or service that facilitates meaningful connections between current students and college alumni, bridging the gap and empowering students to seek academic guidance, mentorship, and career support from experienced individuals.

- Project Description: 

  - Facilitates novice students in establishing connections, learning, and seeking clarification from seniors within their college. Many students struggle to grasp the subjects taught in class and often find it challenging to address their doubts promptly, leading to a waning interest in the subject. This web application serves as a platform to connect these students with their seniors, enabling them to learn, share knowledge, clarify doubts, and excel in their studies.
